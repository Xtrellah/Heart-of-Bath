            <h1>Base Price</h1>
            <p>Our base price is Â£100 per night - for home sitting including maintaining house security,
                indoor plant care as well as garden care and your home as clean and tidy as it was left.</p>
            <p>No two sits are ever the same and a detailed discussion and risk assessment will always be
                carried out before a tailored quote is offered but please see below as a guide to our
                additional daily charges and welcome home hampers and packages which form our pricing
                structure.</p>
            <p>They are designed to ensure that we have considered all factors to tailor to your individual
                pets and needs and will be able to provide you with the very best level of care possible for
                the entirety of the sit.</p>
            <p>If you have multiple pets within the home and would like to discuss pricing, please feel free
                to call to discuss this.</p>
