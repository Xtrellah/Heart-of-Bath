She also pet-sits for longer periods when we are travelling. Megan is incredibly reliable, trustworthy, and great at communication. Most importantly, we know that Otto is well taken care of whenever he is with Megan. She is conscientious and incredibly kind and caring. Otto absolutely loves her. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to have her house sit for us!",

To us, our dogs are our babies, and who we leave them with is not a decision we take lightly, so we were delighted when we found Genine. She is so caring and looks after the dogs brilliantly, and they are always so pleased to see her, which is a great sign too.\n\nWe always have happy pups when we return, and not to overlook, an immaculately clean and tidy house! A real treat!\n\nWe cannot recommend Genine highly enough.",
